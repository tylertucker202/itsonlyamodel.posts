    "\n",
    "Tutorials describe several website use cases step by step and offers the user a break from reading. The [first tutorial](#first_tutorial) narrates a typical use case on how a user can make a custom selection around the Labrador sea at 500-1000 meters during Summer 2017, and download the data and its metadata table locally. The [second tutorial](#second_tutorial) has a user track a particular profile over time, view its profiles, examine unusually cold sea surface temperatures, and download a profile directly from the IFREMER GDAC. More data selection and delivery methods are available using the API, covered in Section~\\ref{sec:api}. \\url{www.itsonlyamodel.us} has more tutorials.\n",

    "1. Visit [www.argovis.com](www.argovis.com). You will be greeted by a Web Mercator projection showing profiles reported by the DACS from the past seven days. Sidebar includes a map reset button, which will return the map to its original state. The clear map button will swipes all profile icons off the map.\n",

    "4. Create a polygon by clicking on the region around the general outline of the Labrador Sea. Circle the polygon nodes back to the point of origin to complete the shape. Upon completion, profiles will only show within the polygon, and a popup will appear, as shown below. With the shape selected, we next need to specify a date and pressure range.\n",

The profile location is close to the Antartic peninsula, indicating that the ice sheets connected to the land are relatively close. Most likely, this data is accurate. As it turns out, sea temperatures freeze at about -2 Celsius. To make sure that the reported data matches the original netCDF file reported in the GDAC the profile page includes a link that will download the netCDF file when clicked. \n",

    "Video tutorials are included [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQE6R74BkyVV3PeTRdGh-W5llAY4XJ8v). The videos guide users through a series of Argovis's features. The advantage of videos over paper tutorials is that users can view, pause, and rewind videos. Youtube also broadcasts the videos over their website, increasing the odds of new users stumbling upon the app. Youtube videos also provide feedback input. The user community can voice support, frustrations and requests in the comments.\n",
